# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cole! Nice to meet you.

## Who am I?

I'm a full-stack software developer with two decades of experience. I've worked all over the place: small & big companies, government, startups both funded & bootstrapped. You name it, I've done it.

Over the years I mostly focused on shipping great software to delight my customers. I progressed from a new graduate all the way up to Principle Engineer before moving into a formal leadership position to lead a team.

The most fulfilling part of leading a team was working with my younger devs to help them level up and achieve their goals.

That's now my entire world as a freelance engineering coach.
