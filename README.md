# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cole! Nice to meet you.

## Who am I?

I'm a full-stack software developer with two decades of experience. I've worked all over the place: small & big companies, government, startups both funded & bootstrapped. You name it, I've done it.

Over the years I mostly focused on shipping great software to delight my customers. I progressed from a new graduate all the way up to Principle Engineer before moving into a formal leadership position to lead a team.

The most fulfilling part of leading a team was working with my younger devs to help them level up and achieve their goals.

That's now my entire world as a freelance engineering coach.

## Featured Repositories
[Lox](https://github.com/colefichter/lox) - written in Erlang, this is an interpreter for a small JavaScript style language. This repository follows along with the amazing (and free) online book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. It chronicles my ongoing interest in, and work to master, compiler implementation techniques.

[DistributedMapReduce3](https://github.com/colefichter/DistributedMapReduce3) - this multi-part tutorial project walks learners through building a fully peer-to-peer MapReduce data processing engine in Erlang.

[NRake](https://github.com/colefichter/NRake) - my C# implementation of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction technique. Used in a large-scale content audit and analysis tool.

[NBoilerpipe](https://github.com/colefichter/NBoilerpipe) - my C# port of the Java boilerpipe project. It was used to detect and separate boilerplate markup from real content in a large-scale content audit and analysis tool.
